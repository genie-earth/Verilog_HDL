# Power of 8


---
### Pipelining
* A structure in which the output of data is connected to the next level of input.
* A buffer (D F/F) is used to relay the input/output of each step.
* First input signal has an output of eight squares after three cycles. (Latency = 3)
* From then on, the result of the eight square comes out every cycle. (Throughput = 1)
